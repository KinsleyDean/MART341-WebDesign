                <p>What are they and what are they used for?
                    <ul>
                        <li><h3> The most well known gear is your mask, snorkel, and fins. These tools make swimming easier, faster, and more sufficient to swimmers, snorkelers and divers alike.</h3></li>
                            
                            <li><h3>The wetsuit, boots, and gloves are all used for bodily protecting, and for insulating and retain body heat while under water.</h3></li>
                           
                            <li><h3>The regulator, octo, computer, and gauge (the regulator system) are all connected together by different tubes that meet together at an air filter contraption.
                            This contraption is placed and sealed onto an air tank, in order for the diver to use and read the air form inside of it. 
                            This will tell the diver how much air they have consumed, and how air they have left, as well as the amount of time and depth they have been diving.</h3></li>
                            
                            <li><h3>The Bouyancy Control Device (BCD) connects to the tank with a velcro/plastic strap in order for the diver to carry the tank with them.
                            Additionally the Regulator system attaches to the BCD, in order to add air to the vest, in order to control your bouyancy.
                            This device helps you go up and down in the water, without having to swim.</h3></li>
                            
                            <li><h3>There are an abundant amount of other gear types and nic-nacs that can be added by the diver, but these basics are what make scuba diving safe and possible!</h3></li>
