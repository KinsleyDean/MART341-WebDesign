            Born in 1806, Barrett Browning spent most of her adult life as

         an invalid, 
            ruled over by a tyrannical father who forbade any of his sons and daughters
             to marry. She married Robert Browning in 1846 after a courtship that had to
              be kept secret. Despite her poor health, Barrett Browning was renowned during
               her lifetime for her intelligence and open-mindedness. ‘How do I love thee?’ 
               is her most famous poem, reproduced in countless anthologies of love poetry.

                <p>How do I love thee?’ was first published in the collection Sonnets from the Portuguese
                     (1850), which Elizabeth Barrett Browning dedicated to her husband, the poet Robert Browning. 
                     The poem is a conventional Petrarchan sonnet that lists the different ways in which the poet 
                     loves her husband. It follows in a tradition of sonnet-writing that reaches back to the poetry 
                     of the Renaissance, showing affection for one’s beloved whilst also displaying one’s own poetic skill.</p>
