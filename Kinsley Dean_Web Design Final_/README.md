How did your user testing sessions go?
They went mostly how I would expect them to go. My website in links and pictures is working, but my classes and contact html are not following the CSS and I do not know why, so things looked funky in a few places. Need to add one morre page to my website about instructor still.

What changes (if any) did you make to your website based on the user feedback you received?
I havent been able to change anything yyet cause Im stuck, and would like to have a meeting with shanel, but her calendy isnt up anymore and she is not answering emails to answer question at the moment. Im hoping to get further instruction soon.
